routing notes
routes are file based in next.js
use folders for nested routes


**dynamic routing**
(in homepage folder)
create a file wrapped in [] for a dynamic route
use object destructuring to get the info from useRouter().query

**catch all routes**
(in docs folder)
A catch all route is used to have any number of nested routes at a base location. 

Get the params through useRouter().query (returns an array)

To have the base page as a default page for the catch all route, wrap the [...params] in another set of
brackets e.g. [[...params]]
